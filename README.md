The purpose of this project is to build a simple web (JSON over HTTP) API to manage recipes, following a **test-driven development** approach. 

We want to ensure that the emphasis is on practicing all the concepts covered during the course. Therefore, in building this simple API, we will focus on **happy path scenarios** only.

**<u>Note:</u>** for brevity, not all ingredients and instructions are displayed in the examples below.

- [Retrieve recipes][6]
- [Create a recipe][7]
- [Change a recipe][8]
- [Delete a recipe][9]

## Retrieve recipes

> *As a user (through a client of this web API) <br/>*
> *I want to be able to retrieve all the recipes <br/>*
> *So that I can choose what I will cook today.*

#### <u>Example</u>

Given there are 2 recipes in our recipe management system <br/>
When I request to see their details via the `GET /recipes` endpoint <br/>
Then I should get a `200 OK` HTTP response with: <br/>

```JSON
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Creamy courgette lasagne",
        "ingredients": [
            {
                "name": "dried lasagne sheets",
                "quantity": "9"
            },
            {
                "name": "courgette coarsely grated",
                "quantity": "700g (about 6)"
            }
        ],
        "instructions": "Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Put a pan of water on to boil, 
            then cook the lasagne sheets for about 5 mins until softened, but not cooked through..."
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Blackberry pie",
        "ingredients": [
            {
                "name": "blackberries",
                "quantity": "600g"
            },
            {
                "name": "self-raising flour",
                "quantity": "300g (plus extra for dusting)"
            }
        ],
        "instructions": "First, make the pastry. 
            Tip both flours and the sugar into a bowl with a large pinch of salt..."
    }
]

```


## Create a recipe

> *As a user (through a client of this web API) <br/>*
> *I want to be able to create a new recipe as needed <br/>*
> *So that I add to my collection of recipes.*

#### <u>Example</u>

Given the ingredients and instructions of a new recipe below <br/>
When I request to create a new recipe via the `POST /recipes` endpoint <br/>
Then I should get a `201 CREATED` HTTP response. <br/>

```JSON
{
    "name": "Aubergine parmigiana lasagne",
    "ingredients": [
        {
            "name": "large aubergines, trimmed and thinly sliced lengthways",
            "quanity": "3"
        },
        {
            "name": "vegetarian mozzarella, drained and coarsely grated",
            "quanity": "250g"
        }
    ],
    "instructions": "Heat a griddle or large frying pan over a medium-high heat. 
        Brush the aubergine slices on both sides with the olive oil and season with a little salt,
        then griddle in batches until the slices are softened and slightly charred..."
}
```


## Change a recipe

> *As a user (through a client of this web API) <br/>*
> *I want to be able to edit a recipe <br/>*
> *So that I keep an accurate record of my recipes.*

#### <u>Examples</u>

Given the new (partial) instructions of an existing recipe below <br/>
When I request to update a recipe via the `PUT /recipes/{id}` endpoint <br/>
Then I should get a `204 NO CONTENT` HTTP response. <br/>

```JSON
{
    "name": "Aubergine parmigiana lasagne",
    "instructions": "Heat a griddle or large frying pan over a medium-high heat. 
        Brush the aubergine slices on both sides with the olive oil and season with a little salt,
        then griddle in batches until the slices are softened and slightly charred (ensure the heat isnâ€™t too high or the aubergine will char before it softens). 
        Transfer the cooked slices to a plate as you go..."
}
```

<br/>

Given the updated list of ingredients of an existing recipe below <br/>
When I request to update a recipe via the `PUT /recipes/{id}` endpoint <br/>
Then I should get a `204 NO CONTENT` HTTP response. <br/>

```JSON
{
    "name": "Aubergine parmigiana lasagne",
    "ingredients": [
        {
            "name": "garlic cloves, finely sliced",
            "quanity": "6"
        },
        {
            "name": "chopped tomatoes",
            "quanity": "3 x 400g cans"
        }
    ]
}
```


## Delete a recipe

> *As a user (through a client of this web API) <br/>*
> *I want to be able to delete a recipe <br/>*
> *When I no longer need it.*

#### <u>Example</u>

Given a recipe we no longer need in our system <br/>
When I request to delete it via the `DELETE /recipes/{id}` endpoint <br/>
Then I should get a `204 NO CONTENT` response. <br/>
